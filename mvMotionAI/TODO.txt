mvMotionAI TODO list on 4th October 2007

- a complete group behaviours class
  - connection to EntryListNode for set/get parameters
  - group node - individual member node relationship code not implemented

- torque -> omega -> rotation conversion for integrator (and vice versa)
  - 3D moment of inertia calculations

- vehicle type body 
  - rotation & direction interconnected.

- dual type body
  - rotation & direction separate

- local rotational / forces conversion

- matrix & quaternion classes

- left & right handness world conversion

- update position / update rotation flags for integrator

- rotation to box and cylinder for local force collision detection

- groups iterator instead of group pointer for integration
  (inside bodyOp of mvBaseActions/calcFullForces in mvBaseForces) 

- waypoint / pathway helper class for following pathway for integration
  (inside bodyOp of mvBaseActions/calcFullForces in mvBaseForces) 

- degree / radians unit conversions

- separate behaviour integration for each body
  - MV_WEIGHTED_SUM (implemented) as list
  - MV_XOR as list
  - MV_RANDOM as list
  - MV_PRIORITIZED_WEIGHTED as list
  - MV_TREE or combination of all of the above in tree

- 64 bit compatibility
