 * \page todo_page mvMotionAI TODO list
 *
 * mvMotionAI TODO list on 25 March 2008
 *
 * - simple boid type behaviour
 * - torque -> omega -> rotation conversion for integrator (and vice versa)
 * - 3D moment of inertia calculations
 * - vehicle type body 
 * - rotation & direction interconnected.
 * - dual type body
 * 	- rotation & direction separate
 * - local rotational / forces conversion
 * - matrix & quaternion classes
 * - left & right handness world conversion
 * - update position / update rotation flags for integrator
 * - rotation to box and cylinder for local force collision detection
 * - degree / radians unit conversions
 * - separate behaviour integration for each body
 *	- MV_PRIORITIZED_WEIGHTED as list
 * 	- MV_TREE or combination of all of the above in tree
 * - 64 bit compatibility
 * - Removed STL objects for more compatibility.
 * - Use of bitfield structs for saving space (bool = 8 bits => 1 bit (or 8 bools) & some enum flags)
 * 	- classes such as mvForceResult, mvBehaviourResult, mvGroupBehaviourResult, mvForceStatus, mvBody.
 * - up & front facing origin vectors 
 * - integrate timers in the library.
 * _ cylinder shapes in force calculations
 * - collision detection /avoidance as a group behaviour
 * - mvString type typedef interchangeable (i.e. std::string, char*, std::wstring, wchar*)
 * 
 * COMPLETED
 * - a group behaviours class
 * - connection to EntryListNode for set/get parameters
 * - group node individual member node relationship cod implemented
 * - groups iterator instead of group pointer for integration
 * (inside bodyOp of mvBaseActions/calcFullForces in mvBaseForces) 
 * - waypoint / pathway helper class for following pathway for integration
 * (inside bodyOp of mvBaseActions/calcFullForces in mvBaseForces) 
 * - replace custom mvBaseActionLoader for default actions with mvReadyMadeLoaders
 * - removed excessive mvWorld get/set list parameters to reduce size of library
 *  David Young, 2007, 2008.
