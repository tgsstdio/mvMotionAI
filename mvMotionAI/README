mvMotionAI - C++ library for motion based steering behaviours
under the MIT license found in ./COPYING

-------------------------------
*****Current Build Options*****
-------------------------------

On 30 September 2007

There are three options for compiling the mvMotionAI library.

1. Using the Code Blocks workspace located in main directory.
   This workspace contains many projects that are compiled under
   the following environments
      - Windows XP with MinGW GCC compiler
      - Ubuntu with GCC compiler      

2. Using the CMake build file (CMakeLists.txt) to generate the relevant
IDE project format or makefile for your compiler. It has two of the 
four projects/tutorials configured.

3. Using Visual C++ 6.0 workspace in the VisualC++Workspace. Not sure
if it's working correctly.

DON'T USE the automake provided with the project as it's not up to date.

*****File Directories in mvMotionAI full workspace*****
-------------------------------------------------------

backup - General storage directory for old code segements used from
previous versions of mvMotionAI.

bin - location of binaries (& mingw DLL library) after build.
binaries of using examples mvMotionAI, three mvMotionAI lua scripts, plus
various DLLs for running on Windows XP 32 bits

docs -  do not use as the new source code is not commented for Doxygen
	doxygen generated API documentation config file. 

examples-src - source of the compiled programs in bin. Also contains
tutorials and side projects directory.

experimental - prototypes (code + interfaces) of new features for
the mvMotionAI library

include - the header files required for development of applications
using mvMotionAI. The mvMotionAI library header files are located
in include/mv directory. 

include-other - mostly Win32 header files for Lua & other libraries
used in compiled examples

lib - static libraries of linking applications to mvMotionAI
lib-other - static libraries objects used for mvMotionAI examples.

misc - various files and code used in development

src - source code files for the mvMotionAI library.

VisualC++Workspace - MSVC++ 6 workspace for development
