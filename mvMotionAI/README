 * mvMotionAI - C++ library for motion based steering behaviours
 * under the MIT license found in ./COPYING

 *
 * -------------------------------
 *
 * On 30 September 2007
 * 
 * There are three options for compiling the mvMotionAI library.
 * 
 *  1. Using the Code Blocks workspace located in main directory.
 *  This workspace contains many projects that are compiled under
 *  the following environments
 *     - Windows XP with MinGW GCC compiler
 *     - Ubuntu with GCC compiler      
 *
 * 2. Using the CMake build file (CMakeLists.txt) to generate the relevant
 * IDE project format or makefile for your compiler. It has two of the 
 * four projects/tutorials configured.
 *
 * 3. Using Visual C++ 6.0 workspace in the VisualC++Workspace. Not sure
 * if it's working correctly.
 *
 * DON'T USE the automake provided with the project as it's not up to date.

 * \section file_dirs File Directories in mvMotionAI full workspace
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * \subsection backup
 * - General storage directory for old code segements used from
 * previous versions of mvMotionAI.
 *
 * \subsection bin
 * - location of binaries (& mingw DLL library) after build. 
 * - binaries of using examples mvMotionAI, three mvMotionAI lua scripts, 
 * plus various DLLs for running on Windows XP 32 bits
 *
 * \subsection docs
 * - do not use as the new source code is not commented for Doxygen
 *  doxygen generated API documentation config file. 
 *
 * \subsection examples-src
 * - source of the compiled programs in bin. Also contains
 * tutorials and side projects directory.
 * 
 * \subsection experimental
 * - prototypes (code + interfaces) of new features for
 * the mvMotionAI library
 * 
 * \subsection include
 * - the header files required for development of applications
 * using mvMotionAI. The mvMotionAI library header files are located
 * in include/mv directory. 
 * 
 * \subsection include-other
 * - mostly Win32 header files for Lua & other libraries
 * used in compiled examples
 * 
 * \subsection lib
 * - static libraries of linking applications to mvMotionAI
 *
 * \subsection lib-other
 * - static libraries objects used for mvMotionAI examples.
 * 
 * \subsection misc
 * - various files and code used in development
 * 
 * \subsection src
 * - source code files for the mvMotionAI library.
 * 
 * \subsection VisualC++Workspace
 * - MSVC++ 6 workspace for development
