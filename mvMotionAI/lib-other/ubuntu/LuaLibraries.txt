For the ubuntu Lua 5.0 libraries and binaries, please install them
through Add & Remove/apt-get/synaptic package manager.

Also one of the example application, GL-main.cpp requires OpenGL, GLUT & glu
libraries and binaries.  So they should be installed on the system itself. 

The workstation used for development is i386 ubuntu dapper drake.
