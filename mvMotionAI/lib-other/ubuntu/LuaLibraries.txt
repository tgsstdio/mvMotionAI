For sideproject1 - For the ubuntu Lua 5.1 libraries and binaries,
please install them through Add & Remove/apt-get/synaptic package manager.

Also one of the example application, tutorial2 & tutorial3
(or GL-main.cpp) requires OpenGL, GLUT & glu libraries and binaries.
So they should be installed on the system itself. 

The workstation used for development is i386 ubuntu dapper drake.
