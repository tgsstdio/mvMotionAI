<p>Basic motion/velocity integrator library for 3D worlds with basic behaviours for C++ programs.
An important part is the scripting capabilities which allows easy file loading of
AI settings. Currently the script library Lua is used and is open source under the MIT license.
</p>
<p>
mvMotionAI is a C/C++ & Lua based artificial intelligence module dealing with motion type actions such as
one body follow another or moving towards a single point. These types of actions are referred as
steering behaviours. As well as these common behaviours, this library uses a scripting language, so
the various settings of each behaviour can be changed without recompiling the program.
</p>
<p>
mvMotionAI uses a OpenGL function interface, as most of the functions in the library have a prefix of 'mv'.
The main class in the library is the mvWorld, which contains all of the minor classes. mvWorlds 
contain mvForce (gravity, wind, direction pull), mvObstacles (non-moving objects which are not yet
implemented), mvWaypoints (points or markers in the world).
</p>
<p>
In the library, each moving item such as a car, a bird or person is represented as a mvBody. Each mvBody has various properties such as
its position, maximum speed, direction in the world. These bodies can be grouped together,
Each behaviour has already been written in the library, so there is no feature yet implemented
which allows completely new behaviours to created at run-time.
</p>
<p>
There are four implemented behaviour in the library which are:
</p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>MV_SEEK</td><td>moves towards a way point</td></tr>
<tr><td>MV_FLEE</td><td>moves away from a way point</td></tr>
<tr><td>MV_CLONE</td><td>copies the velocity of another body</td></tr>
<tr><td>MV_PURSUIT</td><td>chases after a moving body</td></tr>
<tr><td>MV_SIMPLE_FLOCK</td><td>a group flocking behaviour consisting of three types of behaviours
             which is similar to boids. They are attraction, separation and cohesion.</td></tr>
</table> 
<p>
The scripting language in this case is Lua. By combination of behaviours above you can create
a different motion. In the test application, the Lua script (Test.lua) contains some behaviours
which the bodies in a worlds follow.
</p>
<p>
For example, to build a world containing a body at (4,1,0) moving towards a way point at
(10,11,4), the following Lua code is:
</p>
<code>
world1 = mvAddWorld('HELLO_WORLD');<br />
body1 = mvAddBody(world1,'MV_PARTICLE','MV_AABOX',4,1,0);<br />
waypoint1 = mvAddWaypoint(world1,'MV_SINGLE_WAYPOINT','MV_AABOX',10,11,4);<br />
-- comments start with --<br />
-- this<br />
mvSetDefaultWaypointForBody(world1,waypoint1,body1);<br />
mvAddBehaviourToBody(world1,body1,'MV_SEEK');
